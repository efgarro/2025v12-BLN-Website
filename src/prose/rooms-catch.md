Just to the side of the main high grounds at BijaLapa Natural, a two-room, rural-style place looks out over an expansive undulating mountain range. On a clear, calm and breezy day the deep blue sky contrasts with the colors of the mountains, which transition from forest green to greyish blue. While sitting on the rustic porch, nothing beats peaceful contemplation with cup of coffee in hand.
