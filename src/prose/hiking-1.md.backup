Several hiking trails allow visitors to immerse themselves in nature, offering the hiker a mental escape into lush green spaces.

### Bijagual Waterfall Trails


The Bijagual Waterfall is one of the tallest waterfalls in Costa Rica and is composed of a series of inclined/vertical drops that added together represent an approximate height of 180m~200m. There are two private reserves that offer entrance to different elevation view points.  

**The first entrance** is located about 5km from the _costanera_ highway on the road going up to the town of Bijagual. It is a private reserve without a name, no phone signal, no internet, no _stinking_ social media, and has been promoted the old fashion way; word of mouth.

This gate is the begining of a challenging a 2km (aprox.) descending trail that reaches the waterfall plunge pool. Once at the basin, one can stand just a few meters away to feel the force of the misty droplets as the water rams into the basin.

Once at the bottom, the visitor can also enjoy some calm river pools.

**The second entrance** is also a private reserve named **Tours Bijagual Waterfall**. At this reserve you can enjoy a self guided hike as well as a horseback riding tour. The trail to the waterfall takes the visitor to a view point located just above mid-height and to the side of the rushing water.

Another popular trail at this reserve takes the visitor to a river pool suitable for rock diving and _water bomb_ splashing.
