The exterior design of the duplex rooms borrows from architectural elements found in many rural buildings; two-slope red metal sheathing roofs, free-falling rainwater, concrete masonry construction, multi-pane windows, natural cross ventilation enhanced by roof fans. The balcony flooring is akin to the flooring found in the bullfighting _Rodondel de Toros_ located across the Bijagual _Plaza de Futbol_.

Similarly, the interior design takes after local handcrafting practices; two-tone painted furniture, rough surfaces resulting from the marks of the sawmill blade. The project includes paintings by a young artist with tropical theme.

Just to the side of the main high grounds at BijaLapa Natural, a two-room, rural-style place looks out over an expansive undulating mountain range. On a clear, calm and breezy day the deep blue sky contrasts with the colors of the mountains, which transition from forest green to greyish blue. While sitting on the rustic porch, nothing beats peaceful contemplation with cup of coffee in hand.
