The exterior design of the twin rooms adopts several features found in many rural buildings; two-slope red metal sheathing roofs, free-falling rainwater, concrete masonry construction, multi-pane windows, natural cross ventilation enhanced by roof fans. The balcony flooring is similar to the flooring found in the bullfighting _Rodondel de Toros_ located across the Bijagual _Plaza de Futbol_.

Similarly, the interior design takes after local handcrafting practices that commonly use wood elements with visible rough surfaces resulting from the marks of the sawmill blade and furniture with two-tone (painted/stained) finish. The project includes tropical theme paintings by a promising artist from San José.
