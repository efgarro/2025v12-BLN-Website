Hidden away, and scarcely a five-minute drive from the center of town, BijaLapa Natural offers [rooms with a view](https://bijalapa.com/rooms) where the grounds and the scenery set the stage for peaceful contemplating. When weather conditions permit, the starry nights are spectacular. 

The town of Bijagual is part of the Central Pacific Coast region, and is located about 35 minutes from the beach towns of Jacó and Herradura, that joined together by proximity, are one of the main hubs for that region.

The pride and joy of BijaLapa Natural is the [Scarlet Macaw Habitat Project](https://bijalapa.com/habitat) which has a simple premise; _plant trees and wildlife will come_. So, for ten years straight, one hundred trees (or more) per year have been planted, and not only the majestic Scarlet Macaw has come to reap the benefits, but many other forms of wildlife too.

Across the [grounds](https://bijalapa.com/grounds), a mixture of blooming flowers keep pollinators busy most of the year, while fruits like bananas attract at least two species of tucans. The embracement of sustainable organic practices has been the shared purpose and vision from day one.

Although dispersed in several nearby locations around town, there are several hiking trails 


 with destinations.
