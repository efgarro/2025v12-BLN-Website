Right from your bed, you can view with the most breath-taken sunrise scene. 

The exterior design of the duplex rooms borrows from architectural elements found in many rural buildings; two-slope red metal sheathing roofs, free-falling rainwater, concrete masonry construction, multi-pane windows, natural cross ventilation enhanced by roof fans. The balcony flooring is akin to the flooring found in the bullfighting _Rodondel de Toros_ located across the Bijagual _Plaza de Futbol_.

Similarly, the interior design takes after local handcrafting practices; two-tone painted furniture, rough surfaces resulting from the marks of the sawmill or chainsaw blade. The project splurged with tropical themed paintings by a family artist.
