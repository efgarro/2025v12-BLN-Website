### The Guarumo Room
This room is named after the Guarumo tree, for its noble and friendly vibe to birds and insects. No wonder they call it **The Restaurant of the Forest**, as it attracts a wide range of birds and insects. Right there on the corner of the balcony, there are two beautiful specimens that cast a friendly aura over this room.

### The Sunrise Room

If weather conditions permit,  you can view the most breath-taken sunrise scene right from your bed. As the sun raises, the unveiling hues shift from orange, to pink to yellow. The chirping of the birds and the cool air lead the sky in a transition from dark to light.
