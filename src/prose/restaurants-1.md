Simple but genuine, you can find local food very fulfilling in two of the restaurants listed below. Tired of rice and beams?, try an _empanada_ or a _tortilla con queso_. Want to take a break from gas-based drinks?, try a _fresco de piña, maracuya, sandía, cas, mora,_ etc.

### Restaurante Sudy

Named after their kids Susan and Dylan, they serve local food in amigable environment right in the center of town. The _empanadas_ are a must-try.

### Rancho Shadday

I call it Doña Marta's Restaurant rather, a bit away from town, she serves local food cooked in a wood burning stove, need I say more?. Great tasting smoothies and spectacular views.

### Pizzería Loit

Tired of local food, this family-run business serves great pizza. The Margarita Pizza is top-notch.
